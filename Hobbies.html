              <h2>My hobbies and Interests</h2>
              <p>There are many hobbies that I have. Most of the prominent I have is to read novels. Other one is customizing the devices such as mobile/PC</p>
              <div class="hobby">
              <h3> Reading Novels</h3>
              <img class="novel" src="./images/book.jpg" alt="book" >
              <p>It happened four years back when I was in grade 10. I was reading comic book but it had only few chapters uploaded to hosting site
                But my curiosity for the plot was deep so I browsed the internet and found that it had a novel as well. Since then I began to 
                passionately read novels which mainly consisted of the asian novels (chinese, japanese, korean). But I also love read many English Novels
                as well. </p> <br/><br/>

              <h3>Customizing PC/Mobile Phones</h3>
              <img class="novel" src="./images/customize.jpg" alt="customize" >
              <p>Since I had my hands on android phone, I always loved to customize to improve the performance of the device. Aside from phones, 
                I also like to do same for the laptops as well. Changing the original firmware and replacing it with customized rom that is 
                much faster and better is what I like to do with my devices. But doing so voids the warranty of the device so I always do it after
                the warranty expires.

                <h3> Javascript and C# in learning process</h3>
                <h4> 7th October, 2020</h4><br/>
                <p>  I am beginning to understand how the javascript works. I learnt this language because its very interactive and we can create UI easily.
                  Also trying to learn C# due to Unity for making games.
