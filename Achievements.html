                <li>Sports</li>
                <p>During my high school days, I used to play football from my house team. I was the mid-fielder and played an very important
                  role in the achieving second place in whole school. 
                </p> <br/>
                <li> Academics </li>
                <p>I have always been a student who does well in the exam. For most of the times in the school or college, I have always been in 
                  top ten of the class among almost 100 students. As far I can remember, I have always performed well and passed exams with flying colors
                </p>
                <li>Competitions such as Debate, Quiz, Spelling </li>
                <p>I used to take part in many competitions because I loved rivalry between classmates. The thought of winning against other students makes
                  me pumped up. Most of the time, during the quiz and spelling competition, although mostly I didn't win first place, I won the second place
                  due to the fierce competitions.
                </p>
